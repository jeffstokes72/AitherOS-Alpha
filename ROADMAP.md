# AitherOS Roadmap

> This is the public-facing roadmap. Updated as milestones are completed.

## Vision

AitherOS aims to be the first true **agentic operating system** — a platform where AI agents don't just respond to prompts but autonomously manage infrastructure, create content, heal failures, and improve themselves. All while humans maintain governance.
